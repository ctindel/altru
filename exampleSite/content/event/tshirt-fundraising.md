Spend a weekend making a lasting impact by planting native trees at the Oakwood Nature Reserve. This hands-on event is perfect for individuals, families, and corporate groups looking to give back to the environment.

## Event Details

Over the two-day event, we aim to plant 5,000 native trees across 20 acres of restored land. Expert foresters will guide each team, and participants will learn about native species selection and proper planting techniques.
