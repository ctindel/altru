Join hundreds of volunteers for our annual river cleanup along the Willamette River. Together we will remove debris, restore riverbanks, and celebrate the beauty of our waterways. All supplies provided. Families and groups welcome.

## What to Expect

Volunteers will work in teams along designated sections of the river. We provide gloves, bags, and safety equipment. After the cleanup, enjoy a community picnic with live music and educational activities about watershed conservation.
