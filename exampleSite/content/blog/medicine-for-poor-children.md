Forests are among our most powerful allies in the fight against climate change. They absorb carbon dioxide, regulate water cycles, and provide habitat for countless species. Yet every year, millions of acres of forest are lost to deforestation.

## Why Reforestation Matters

At Altru, our reforestation programs focus on restoring degraded land with native tree species. We work alongside local communities to ensure that newly planted forests are maintained and protected for generations to come. Our approach combines scientific research with traditional ecological knowledge to maximize biodiversity and carbon sequestration.
