Every year, an estimated eight million tons of plastic waste enters our oceans, threatening marine ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. From microplastics in the food chain to massive garbage patches, the scale of the problem demands urgent action.

## What Altru Is Doing

Our ocean conservation programs organize coastal cleanups, advocate for stronger waste management policies, and support research into biodegradable alternatives. Together with our volunteers and partners, we have removed over 500 tons of debris from coastlines worldwide.
