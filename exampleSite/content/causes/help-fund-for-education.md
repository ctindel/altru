Critical wildlife habitats are disappearing at an alarming rate. Our habitat protection program works to secure and restore land that serves as home to endangered species, ensuring that biodiversity is preserved for future generations.

## How We Protect Habitats

We partner with landowners, governments, and conservation groups to establish protected areas, create wildlife corridors, and implement sustainable land management practices that benefit both people and nature.
