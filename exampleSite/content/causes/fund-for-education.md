Our ocean cleanup campaign mobilizes volunteers and deploys innovative technology to remove plastic waste from coastlines and waterways. We target the most polluted areas where intervention can have the greatest ecological impact.

## Join the Effort

From beach cleanups to river barriers, every dollar you donate helps us scale our operations and protect marine life from the devastating effects of pollution.
